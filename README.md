# Bachelors Thesis Implementation

This repository contains additional files for my Bachelor's Thesis on Formal Gamespaces for Artificial Intelligence in Games.

There is one folder for each AI variant, containing 
- built files for training
- the resulting training data 
- an AI.yaml file which is the training configuration
- the final trained neural network (.onnx)

To train the agents yourself, just follow the documentation for the Unity ML-Agents Toolkit (https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/release_19_docs/docs/Readme.md)
